# CS-300 Analysis and Design
SNHU
Project 1 and 2


1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For this course’s projects the problem presented was to write pseudocode, a runtime analysis for all 3 data structures (vector, hash table and binary tree search) and code for the chosen data structure. The scenario was the following: The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU are very happy with the pseudocode you completed. You are now prepared to move forward with expanding the pseudocode to directly respond to the two items advising hopes to accomplish with this program. Remember, your program will need to do the following: ABCU is looking for software that will help their computer science advisors access course information for students. The program should show a menu to give the user the option to: 1. Load file data into data structure, 2. Display list of all courses in alphanumerical order, 3. Display course title and prerequisites for any individual course and 4. Exit the program. The program will then, depending on the user input open the file, read the data from the file, parse each line, and check for file format errors. A Course Information document was provided and linked. It contains all the information about the courses required in the Computer Science curriculum for ABCU. Each line consists of the information about a single course, including the course number, title, and prerequisites. 


2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In order to fulfill the requirements, I wrote pseudocodes for all 3 data structures. I started with outlining the structure of my pseudocode and then went to define the details necessary for the program to work. I decided to use a binary search tree because it is fast and well structured especially as the courses are related to one another, as some courses are prerequisites for other courses.


3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I got stuck, I opted to get help from either a tutor or searching the internet. I had some troubles with small errors which did not make sense like “;” in places where clearly none belong etc. Also, I got errors which later just disappeared. In those cases, I contacted my instructor.


4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It became clear that using a suitable data structure is very important for the smooth operation of any program. Nothing is more annoying for a user than using a program that is either very slow or even gets constantly stuck. Knowing that, helped me to put thought into which data structure to use for different requirements. I now have a different way of approaching a project depending on what the program is intended to do.


5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I always tried to keep things organized and structured in the past, so the program would be easily maintainable and readable but with the option of choosing between different data structures this will increase my adaptability to client wishes and program requirements for future projects.
